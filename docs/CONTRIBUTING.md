# Contributing Guide

Hello! Thank you for taking an interest in helping us improve! This document serves to help you learn how to contribute to the project.

See ["Contributing to the Wiki"](./CONTRIBUTING-WIKI.md).

# Contribution Types

We appreciate all contributions, whether you want to add a feature, add documentation to the wiki, fix a typo, or just get involved in the conversation in [issues](https://github/LuaLS/website/issues) and [discussions](https://github.com/LuaLS/website/discussions).

Here are some great ways to get involved:

- Create an issue
  - Report unexpected behaviour with the site.
  - Report old, confusing, or incorrect documentation.

- Create a discussion
  - Chat about more general topics that aren't really an "issue".
  - Share your ideas.

- Assist with existing issues
  - Find [issues needing help](https://github.com/LuaLS/website/labels/help%20wanted) and [issues for new contributors](https://github.com/LuaLS/website/contribute).

- Create a pull request
  - Quickly fix typos and bad links.
  - [Add content to the wiki](./CONTRIBUTING-WIKI.md)

> **Note**
> If you are unsure which medium is best for expressing your idea or concern, start with an issue.
