import Diagnostic from "~/components/wiki/Diagnostic.astro";

Diagnostics can report possible issues at different severities such as `Information`, `Warning`, `Error`, etc.

Also see [syntax errors](/wiki/syntax-errors).

# List of all diagnostics

Below is a list of all diagnostics. They are organized into groups that are used by [`diagnostics.groupFileStatus`](/wiki/settings#diagnosticsgroupfilestatus) and [`diagnostics.groupSeverity`](/wiki/settings#diagnosticsgroupseverity). The default severity is shown, but these can be edited using [`diagnostics.groupSeverity`](/wiki/settings#diagnosticsgroupseverity) and [`diagnostics.severity`](/wiki/settings#diagnosticsseverity). Some also list their default value for [`diagnostics.neededFileStatus`](/wiki/settings#diagnosticsneededfilestatus)

## ambiguity

The ambiguity diagnostic group contains diagnostics that have to do with ambiguous cases.

<Diagnostic level="Warning">
<span slot="name">
### ambiguity-1
</span>
Triggered when there is an ambiguous statement that may need some brackets in order to correct the order of operations.

![ambiguity-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61925890/181308848-15193c22-82bf-4dae-93f3-30deefd678b6.png)

</Diagnostic>

<Diagnostic level="Warning">
<span slot="name">
### count-down-loop
</span>
Triggers when a `for` loop will never reach its max/limit because it is incrementing when it should be decrementing.

```Lua
for i=10, 1 do end
```

</Diagnostic>

<Diagnostic level="Warning">
<span slot="name">
### different-requires
</span>
Triggered when a file is required under two different names. This can happen when requiring a file in two different directories:

```plaintext
ðŸ“¦ myProject/
    â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ helpers/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œ strings.lua
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“œ pretty.lua
    â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“œ main.lua
```

```Lua
-- main.lua
local strings = require("helpers.strings")
local pretty = require("helpers.pretty")
```

```Lua
-- helpers/pretty.lua
local strings = require("strings")
```

</Diagnostic>

<Diagnostic level="Warning">
<span slot="name">
### newfield-call
</span>
Triggered when calling a function across two lines from within a table. This may be unwanted and you may want to separate the fields with a comma (`,`) or semicolon (`;`) - unless you want to call the first field as a function.

```Lua
local myTable = {
  myFunc
  ("param")
}
```

</Diagnostic>

<Diagnostic level="Warning">
<span slot="name">
### newline-call
</span>
Triggered when calling a function from the next line. This may be unintended and you may want to add a semicolon `;` to end the line.

```Lua
print(1)
('x'):sub(1, 2)
```

</Diagnostic>

## await

The await group contains diagnostics for asynchronous code.

<Diagnostic level="Warning">
<span slot="name">
### await-in-sync

</span>
**Default File Status:** `"None"`

Triggered when attempting to call `coroutine.yield()` when it is not permitted.

</Diagnostic>

## codestyle

The codestyle group contains diagnostics for maintaining a good code style.

<Diagnostic level="Warning">
<span slot="name">
### codestyle-check
</span>
**Default File Status:** `"None"`

</Diagnostic>

<Diagnostic level="Information">
<span slot="name">
### spell-check
</span>
**Default File Status:** `"None"`

Triggered when a typo is detected in a string. The dictionary can be customized using the [`Lua.spell.dict` setting](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/wiki/Settings#spelldict).

</Diagnostic>

## duplicate

The duplicate group contains diagnostics for duplicate indexes and names.

<Diagnostic level="Warning">
<span slot="name">
### duplicate-index
</span>

Triggered when there are duplicate indices.

```Lua
local t = {
    -- triggered by indexes
    [1] = "a",
    [1] = "b",

    -- triggered by keys as well
    two = "c",
    two = "d"
}
```

</Diagnostic>

<Diagnostic level="Warning">
<span slot="name">
### duplicate-set-field
</span>

Triggered when setting the same field in a class more than once. Check the names of your fields.

```Lua
---@class myClass
local myTable = {}

function myTable:x() end

</Diagnostic>

## global

The global group contains diagnostics that deal with the global scope.

<Diagnostic level="Warning">

_ENV = {}
print(A)
```

</Diagnostic>

<Diagnostic level="Warning">
<span slot="name">
### undefined-global

</Diagnostic>

## redefined

The redefined group contains diagnostics that warn when variables are being redefined.

<Diagnostic level="Hint">
<span slot="name">
### redefined-local
</span>
Triggered when a local variable is being redefined. This will result in the redefinition being underlined. While still legal, it could cause confusion when trying to use the previously defined version of the local variable that may have since been mutated. It is good practice not to re-use local variable names for this reason.

</Diagnostic>

## strict

The strict group contains diagnostics considered "strict". These can help you write better code but may require more work to follow.

<Diagnostic level="Warning">
<span slot="name">
### clone-non-object
</span>
Triggered when attempting to [close a variable](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html#3.3.8) with a non-object. The value of the variable must be an object with the `__close` metamethod (a Lua 5.4 feature).

```Lua
local x <close> = 1
```

</Diagnostic>

<Diagnostic level="Warning">
<span slot="name">
### deprecated

</Diagnostic>

<Diagnostic level="Warning">
<span slot="name">
### discard-returns

<Diagnostic level="Warning">
<span slot="name">
### assign-type-mismatch
</span>
Triggered when assigning a value, in which its type does not match the type of the variable it is being assigned to.

The below will trigger this diagnostic because we are assigning a `boolean` to a `number`:

```Lua
---@type number
local isNum = false
```

</Diagnostic>

<Diagnostic level="Warning">
<span slot="name">
### cast-local-type
</span>
Triggered when a local variable is being cast to a different value than it was defined as.

---@field move function

---@type Bicycle|nil
local bicycle

-- need to make sure bicycle isn't nil first
bicycle.move()
```

</Diagnostic>

<Diagnostic level="Warning">

end
```

</Diagnostic>

<Diagnostic level="Warning">
<span slot="name">
### undefined-field
</span>
Triggered when referencing an undefined field.

```Lua
---@class myClass
local myClass = {}
