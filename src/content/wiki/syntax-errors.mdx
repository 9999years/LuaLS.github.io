A syntax error will appear when the Lua syntax has been violated, which will result in a error at runtime.

These work _similar_ to [diagnostics](/wiki/diagnostics).

## List of all syntax errors

Below is a list of all of the possible syntax errors that can be reported by the language server:

### action-after-return

Triggered when there is unreachable code after a `return`.

### args-after-dots

Triggered when there is a parameter defined after a variable arguments symbol (`...`).

### block-after-else

Triggered when there is an `else` or `elseif` after a terminating `else` in an `if` statement.

```Lua
if myVar then
    print("Truthy")
else
    print("Falsy")
elseif nil then --Error!

end
```

### break-outside

Triggered when a `break` is placed outside of a `break`-able loop.

### err-assign-as-eq

Triggered when using the equality symbol (`==`) to assign a variable. You should instead use the assignment symbol `=`.

### err-c-long-comment

Triggered when using `/** */` for multi-line comments instead of `--[[ ]]`, as required by Lua's syntax. You should instead use `--[[ ]]` for your multi-line comments.

### err-comment-prefix

Triggered when using `//` for comments instead of `--`, as required by Lua's syntax. You should instead use `--` for your comments and `---` for your annotations.

### err-do-as-then

Triggered when using `then` instead of `do` for a `while` loop.

### err-eq-as-assign

Triggered when using the assignment symbol (`=`) to test equality. You should instead use the equality symbol `==`.

### err-esc

Triggered when an unknown escape sequence is found, such as `"\c"`.

### err-nonstandard-symbol

Triggered when using a non-Lua symbol like `&&` instead of `and` or `||` instead of `or`.

### err-then-as-do

Triggered when using `do` instead of `then` in an `if` statement.

### exp-in-action

Triggered when there is an unexpected expression like in `local 3 + 2 = 10` - there is an unexpected expression during an assignment action.

### index-in-func-name

Triggered when there is an indexing operation taking place in a function's name e.g. `function myTable[1]() end`.

### jump-local-scope

Triggered when a local variable is "jumped" over using `goto` and labels. "jumping" the variable means it is never defined and will cause errors when it is referenced. This diagnostic serves to protect against such errors.

```Lua
goto jump

local a = 10

::jump::
-- a is jumped over by this label,
-- meaning it is never defined

print(a)
```

### keyword

Triggered when using a reserved keyword as a name e.g. `local true = "hello"`.

### local-limit

Triggered when the limit for `local` variables has been reached in this scope. Lua has a [limit of 200 local variables](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66539256) in each scope.

### malformed-number

Triggered when a malformed number is found like `0y16` instead of `0x16` or `0.0.4`.

### miss-end

Triggered when an `end` is missing from an `if`, `for`, `while`, or `function`. This is usually due to nesting and a matching `end` is missing from an outer `if`, `for`, etc.

### miss-esc-x

Triggered when the hexadecimal digits are missing from an `\x` hexadecimal escape.

### miss-exp

Triggered when an expression is missing from your code. For example, forgetting the expression to an if statement, i.e. `if then end`.

### miss-exponent

Triggered when the exponent has been left out when representing a number in exponent form.

```Lua
local incorrect = 1e
local correct = 1e10
```

### miss-field

Triggered when a field reference is underway but no field name has been given e.g. `print(myTable.)`.

### miss-loop-max

Triggered when the maximum (limit) to a `for` loop is not provided.

### miss-loop-min

Triggered when the minimum (start) to a `for` loop is not provided.

### miss-method

Triggered when a method (`:`) is being called but the method name is not provided e.g. `Class:`.

### miss-name

Triggered when the name is missing to a function/method.

### miss-sep-in-table

Triggered when a separator (`,` or `;`) is missing from a table.

### miss-space-between

<Remark type="WIP" display="compact">Description needed</Remark>

### miss-symbol

<Remark type="WIP" display="compact">Description needed</Remark>

### set-const

<Remark type="WIP" display="compact">Description needed</Remark>

### unexpect-dots

Triggered when using the variable arguments symbol (`...`) outside of a function that has variable arguments.

### unexpect-efunc-name

Triggered when a function is being assigned to a variable and is also given a name.

```Lua
local x = function x() end
```

### unexpect-lfunc-name

Triggered when a function is marked as local. The method either belongs to a table or is a local function, not both.

```Lua
local function x:t() end
```

### unexpect-symbol

<Remark type="WIP" display="compact">Description needed</Remark>

### unicode-name

Triggered when a variable name contains unicode characters. Unicode characters can be allowed by disabling this diagnostic or by enabling [`runtime.unicodeName`](/wiki/settings#runtimeunicodename).

### unknown-attribute

<Remark type="WIP" display="compact">Description needed</Remark>

### unknown-symbol

Triggered when an unknown symbols is found like in `local a = &`. A simple syntax error, most likely a typo.
